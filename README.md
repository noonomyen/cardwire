# Disclaimer

- This project is in early development. Expect bugs and incomplete functionality

## Getting Started

Head to the [docs](https://opengamingcollective.github.io/cardwire) to see how to install and use Cardwire on your system

## Fork Modifications

For custom features and modifications included in this fork (such as user-defined `allowed_programs`), see [docs/customizations.md](docs/customizations.md).

## How it works

Cardwire uses eBPF with LSM hooks to intercept file operations on GPU device nodes, such as `/dev/dri/renderDX`, `/dev/dri/cardX`, sysfs `config`, `nvidiaX` and other GPU-related files.

When a GPU is "blocked," the eBPF program returns `-ENOENT` for any syscall targeting that device, effectively hiding it from apps. This provides several key benefits:

- **Instant App Startup:** Prevents applications (like Electron apps or GTK apps) from attempting to initialize the GPU, this eliminates the 3–4 second "hang" typically caused by waiting for a sleeping GPU to power up
- **Power Efficiency:** By blocking access at the syscall level, the GPU is never woken from its lowest power state (D3cold), extending battery life on laptops
- **Non-Invasive:** Unlike traditional methods that might require driver unloading, risky unbind or complex Wayland setups, this approach is transparent to the rest of the system and easy to toggle

_Note: X11 is not supported. Cardwire requires Wayland._
